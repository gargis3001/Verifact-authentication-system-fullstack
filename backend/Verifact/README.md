## üîß Verifact Backend - Spring Boot Authentication API

Java Spring Boot backend for the **Verifact** authentication system. This service powers the RESTful APIs that manage user authentication, registration, and profile management, supporting a React-based frontend.

### üöÄ Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Version | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|---------|
| Runtime | Java | 21 | Application platform |
| Framework | Spring Boot | 3.5.4 | Application framework |
| Build Tool | Maven | 3.9.11 | Dependency management and build |
| Database | MySQL | Latest | User data persistence |
| Security | Spring Security | 6.x | Authentication and authorization |
| JWT | JJWT | 0.9.1 | Token generation and validation |
| ORM | Spring Data JPA | 3.x | Database abstraction layer |
| Email | Spring Mail | 3.x | Email notification services |
| Code Generation | Lombok | 1.18.38 | Boilerplate code reduction |

### üåê API Architecture

The backend exposes RESTful APIs over HTTP on `localhost:8080`. These APIs follow standard controller-service-repository architecture using Spring Boot conventions with JWT-based authentication.

#### üìã Endpoint Summary

| HTTP Method | Endpoint | Purpose | Authentication |
|-------------|----------|---------|---------------|
| POST | `/register` | User registration | Public |
| POST | `/verify-otp` | Email verification | Public |
| POST | `/login` | User authentication | Public |
| POST | `/reset-password` | Password reset request | Public |
| POST | `/update-password` | Password update | Public |
| GET | `/profile` | Get user profile | JWT Required |
| PUT | `/profile` | Update user profile | JWT Required |

### üîí Security Features
